## Quick Note

I didn't know the jokes were going to be as dark as they are. As I was developing this, I started to realize that dark humor is an acquired taste, and the audience needs to be familiar with you a little. Therefore, I'd like to apologize ahead of time. This project was a way for me to start exploring Gatsby.js.

You've been warned!
